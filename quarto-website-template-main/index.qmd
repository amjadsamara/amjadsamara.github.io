# Hi, my name is Amjad Samara!

I am a first year MS/Neuroimmunology fellow at Cleveland Clinic. I am also a graduate student at Case Western Reserve University. I completed my neurology residency at Washington University in St. Louis, where I also conducted extensive research using advanced neuroimaging techniques to study neuroinflammation and brain structure-function relationships in multiple sclerosis.

My current research interests are related to imaging biomarkers for clinical trials in progressive MS. 

On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be attending. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life's work. 


Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:axs3670@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
