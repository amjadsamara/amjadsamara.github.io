    "text": "In this study, we used quantitative gradient-recalled echo (qGRE) MRI to investigate the pattern of thalamic tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its relationship with clinical disability. Building on the hypothesis that MS-related neurodegeneration follows a “surface-in” pattern from the ventricular surface, we quantified tissue integrity across concentric 1-mm thalamic bands using R2t* as a measure of microstructural health. Compared to healthy controls, MS patients exhibited a significantly steeper periventricular thalamic gradient of R2t*, indicating greater loss of tissue integrity near the ventricular surface. This increased gradient was symmetrical across both thalami and correlated with longer disease duration and higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, suggesting a link between periventricular thalamic damage and clinical disability. Our findings provide in vivo evidence supporting the CSF-mediated, surface-in neurodegeneration hypothesis in MS and demonstrate that qGRE MRI offers a sensitive tool for detecting subtle, spatially organized thalamic pathology related to disease progression."

    "text": "Neuroinflammation and White Matter Alterations in Obesity Assessed by Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging\n\nIn this study, we investigated whether obesity in humans is associated with neuroinflammation and white-matter microstructural alterations using Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI), an advanced diffusion MRI method that distinguishes between inflammation-related cellularity, edema, and axonal integrity. Across two independent adult cohorts, we found that obese individuals exhibited increased DBSI-restricted fraction—interpreted as greater cellularity consistent with neuroinflammation — and decreased DBSI-fiber fraction, indicating reduced apparent axonal density, across multiple white-matter tracts. These effects were also evident in key gray-matter regions such as the hippocampus and amygdala, and in exploratory analyses, some of these imaging markers correlated with poorer cognitive performance. Importantly, these findings were present even in metabolically healthy obese participants, suggesting that obesity itself may contribute to neuroinflammatory and structural brain changes. Our results support the view that neuroinflammation is a potential mechanistic link between obesity and cognitive impairment and demonstrate that DBSI offers improved specificity over traditional diffusion tensor imaging for detecting microstructural alterations related to inflammatory processes in the human brain."

Welcome to my website!\nI am a neuroimmunology fellow at Cleveland Clinic and a graduate student at Case Western Reserve University. In addition to my clinical work, I am interested in advanced neuroimaging research and applications to study multiple sclerosis (MS).\nMy current work focuses on identifying imaging biomarkers of disease progression in MS, with the goal of improving our understanding of its underlying pathology and developing reliable outcome measures for future clinical trials.\nIn my free time, I enjoy watching and playing soccer - a Liverpool fan YNWA. I also like to travel and explore new national parks across the US.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
